								<h3></h3>
								<p>Jaimee was born into a Korean/Chinese family in London, Ontario, and grew up in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). She is a Mathematics co-op student at the University of Waterloo, and is in the midst of her second year.
									As she has not declared a major just yet, she is still using this time to experiment with as many math major courses as possible to see where here interest lies. However, she does have a strong interest in
								statistics and computer science, and is constantly learning more about data science concepts and tools (ex. AI, Azure, ML, etc.). On the other hand, Jaimee also likes to experiment with front-end and 
							back-end development. </p>

								<p>Jaimee joined Code for San Jose in March 2021, which is a Code for America brigade that strives to create solutions for local issues. Jaimee has been doing DevOps work for the multiple projects that 
									Code for San Jose is responsible for. She has learned Terraform/Terragrunt, and AWS. As she is still new to the organization, she is still actively learning more and more every day. 
								</p>

								<p>If Jaimee isn't working, she is probably on a hike with her dog, Teddy, or watching some TV. Jaimee is also (trying) to learn film photography with her Canon AE-1, you can see some of her work on this site!</p>
